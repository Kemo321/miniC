### How It Works
The AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) module represents the parsed structure of miniC source code as a hierarchy of nodes. It uses a base ASTNode class for polymorphism, with Expr as the base for expressions (like literals, identifiers, unary/binary operations) and Stmt as the base for statements (like returns, ifs, whiles, assignments, variable declarations). Specific subclasses hold details: for instance, IntLiteral stores an integer value, BinaryExpr links left/right subexpressions with an operator token type, and VarDeclStmt includes type, name, and optional initializer. The Function class groups parameters (via a simple Parameter struct) and body statements, while the top-level Program holds all functions. Nodes are connected via unique pointers for ownership, allowing recursive tree building without cycles. Dynamic casting is used downstream for type-specific handling, but the structure itself is lightweight and focused on syntax representation.

### Example of Use
After parsing source code, the AST is built by creating nodes like an IntLiteral for a number, wrapping it in a BinaryExpr for addition with an Identifier, then placing that in an AssignStmt for a variable, and finally enclosing it in a Function's body under a Program. This tree can then be traversed by a visitor to perform analysis or generation, such as checking types or emitting IR for a simple expression like "x = 1 + 2;".
