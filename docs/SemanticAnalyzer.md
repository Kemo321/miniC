### How It Works
The SemanticAnalyzer class, deriving from ASTVisitor, checks the AST for correctness by traversing nodes and enforcing rules. It uses a stack of symbol tables for scopes (pushed/popped for functions/blocks) and a global function map. For programs, it detects function redefinitions and visits each function, setting its return type. In functions, it declares parameters and visits body statements. For statements, it checks variable declarations (no redeclares, no void types, initializer type match), assignments (declared var, type match), returns (type matches function), ifs/whiles (int condition, visits branches/body). Expressions are validated: identifiers must be declared, binaries/unaries check operand types (e.g., arithmetic needs ints). It infers types for literals/identifiers/binaries and throws SemanticError on issues like undeclared vars or mismatches.

### Example of Use
After parsing, create an instance and call visit on the Program AST for a function with an int declaration, assignment, and return; it verifies the initializer matches int, the assigned value matches the var type, and the return matches the function type, throwing if a string is assigned to an int var.
